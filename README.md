 Project 1: Simple Calculator (Java Swing GUI)
📌 Project Overview
The Simple Calculator is a GUI-based application developed using Java Swing. It performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal of this project was to build a user-friendly desktop application that mimics the functionality of a standard handheld calculator.

💻 Technical Description
Language Used: Java

Libraries: Java Swing (GUI), AWT (Event handling)

Tools: VS Code / Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA

Platform: Desktop (Cross-platform)

🧠 Core Functionalities
Input numbers using on-screen buttons

Perform operations: +, -, *, /

Handles decimal inputs

Error handling for divide-by-zero and invalid input

Clear input using the "C" button

Show real-time results on "=" press

🎯 Objective & Motivation
The primary objective was to get hands-on experience with:

GUI development using Java Swing

Event-driven programming using ActionListener

Managing input/output within a GUI window

This project served as a stepping stone to understand how Java applications interact with user events and GUI components.

📘 What I Learned
How to use Swing components like JFrame, JButton, JTextField, and JLabel

Handling user input and event-driven logic using ActionEvent

Maintaining application state using variables and control flow

GUI layout design and positioning using absolute layout

🚀 Future Enhancements
Add keyboard input support

Allow continuous calculations (e.g., 5 + 2 - 3 * 4)

Implement a scientific mode with more operations (%, square root, etc.)

Add dark/light mode toggle

💱 Project 2: Currency Converter (Java GUI Application)
📌 Project Overview
The Currency Converter is a utility application built using Java that allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another. It supports multiple currencies and provides an intuitive interface. The project currently uses static exchange rates, but it lays the groundwork for future integration of real-time API data.

💻 Technical Description
Language Used: Java

Libraries: Java Swing (GUI Components)

Currency Data: Static 2D array for rates (no API)

Platform: Desktop (Cross-platform)

🧠 Core Functionalities
Select "From" and "To" currencies using JComboBox

Input the amount in a JTextField

View the converted result in a read-only field

Perform conversion using a Convert button

Error handling for non-numeric inputs

🎯 Objective & Motivation
The purpose of building a currency converter was to practice:

Developing applications with multiple interactive GUI elements

Using 2D arrays and logic to simulate data mapping (exchange rates)

Enhancing user interaction skills through well-structured layouts

Preparing for real-world scenarios where API and UI need to work together

📘 What I Learned
Mapping user selections to conversion logic

Handling multiple GUI components with different states

Formatting numeric results to 2 decimal places

Creating responsive layouts and intuitive flow

🌐 Real-world Relevance
Currency conversion is a common task in travel, international trade, and finance. This tool mimics real-life applications like XE.com or Google Currency Converter, providing both a practical and educational learning experience.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrate a live currency exchange rate API (like ExchangeRate-API or OpenExchangeRates)

Add more currencies and search functionality

Show rate history or trends using charts

Allow offline rate caching

Add localization (display currency names in native language)

🎓 Conclusion
Both projects helped develop key programming skills:
